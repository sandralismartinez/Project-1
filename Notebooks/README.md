## For this project, six conclusions have to be cited:

1. As someone ages, he or she has more chances of dying of the COVID-19.


2. People younger than 55 are much more affected by the COVID-19 than people older than 55 although very few of them die from it. 
   Besides that, more people older than 55 die from the COVID-19 compared to poeple that are younger than 55.
   
3. The state of California, all age groups mixed up, has the highest number of COVID-19 deaths of the five states that we analyzed 
   while the state of Virginia, all age groups mixed up, has the lowest number of COVID-19 deaths of the five states that we analyzed. 
   
4. The state of California has the biggest sample and the biggest mean of the five states that we analyzed (California, Connecticut, 
   Florida, Georgia, Virginia) when it comes to COVID-19 deaths while the state of Virginia has the smallest sample and the smallest 
   mean of those five states.
   
5. For all age groups, total deaths won't necessarily go up when the COVID-19 deaths increase.


6. The number of total deaths is necessarily going to go up if the pneumonia and COVID-19 deaths increase jointly.
